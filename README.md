Student Performance Prediction Project - UTA
Project Introduction: This dataset contains details for 30,000 imaginary students at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA).  All students were admitted in Fall semesters, and all First Time In College (FTIC) students (they have no postsecondary education prior to enrolling at UTA).  Each row in the dataset corresponds to a single student and contains some details of their first semester.
